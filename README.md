# CRISP-Content-Based-Rapid-Image-Search-Using-Parallel-Computing
Implemented a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system using feature extraction and Chi-Square distance. Compared sequential and multithreaded parallel processing (via ThreadPoolExecutor) to improve retrieval speed. Achieved significant speedup in image similarity search using Hu Moments and color histograms.
